# Decentralized Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Verification

A blockchain-based platform for ensuring medication integrity, authenticity, and safety through transparent tracking and verification from manufacturer to patient.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to combat counterfeit pharmaceuticals, ensure proper handling throughout the supply chain, and build consumer trust in medication authenticity. By creating an immutable record of a drug's journey—from production through distribution to dispensing—the platform enables all stakeholders to verify medication provenance and handling conditions, ultimately enhancing patient safety and public health outcomes.

## Core Components

### 1. Manufacturer Verification Contract

The manufacturer verification contract establishes the legitimacy of pharmaceutical producers:
- Validates manufacturing licenses and regulatory approvals
- Verifies Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certifications
- Records manufacturing facility inspections and compliance status
- Implements credential verification through regulatory authority APIs
- Maintains authorization status for specific drug production categories
- Tracks manufacturer reputation based on compliance history
- Enables regulatory authority oversight through permissioned access
- Provides revocation mechanisms for non-compliant manufacturers

### 2. Batch Tracking Contract

The batch tracking contract creates a complete chain of custody for medications:
- Assigns unique identifiers to each production batch and individual unit
- Records critical production data (ingredients, processes, quality tests)
- Tracks custody transfers between authorized supply chain participants
- Implements packaging validation through tamper-evident seals
- Manages recall functionality with immediate notification capability
- Enables lot genealogy and full component traceability
- Creates verifiable chain-of-custody documentation
- Supports serialization standards (GS1, DSCSA, FMD compliance)

### 3. Temperature Monitoring Contract

The temperature monitoring contract ensures proper environmental conditions:
- Integrates with IoT sensors for real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- Records environmental data at configurable intervals
- Validates storage conditions against product-specific requirements
- Issues automated alerts for excursions outside acceptable parameters
- Calculates stability impact from temperature excursions
- Implements cold chain validation for temperature-sensitive medications
- Provides immutable environmental history for regulatory documentation
- Supports quarantine flagging for compromised shipments

### 4. Authentication Contract

The authentication contract enables verification of medication authenticity:
- Provides consumer-facing verification through mobile applications
- Implements multiple authentication methods (QR codes, NFC, serial verification)
- Displays complete provenance information in user-friendly format
- Supports adverse event reporting linked to specific medication units
- Enables pharmacist verification before dispensing
- Issues tamper-evident digital certificates for dispensed medications
- Facilitates secure communication channel for patient questions
- Supports multi-language interfaces for global accessibility
